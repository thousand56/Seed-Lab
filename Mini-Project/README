The goal of this project is to have a computer vision marker location determine the rotation of a motor.

Process:

Computer Vision captures the frame and determines the location of the marker (NW, NE, SW, SE)
This is passed to an LCD display and to the arduinos
Arduinos determine the radial position the encoder must spin to
PID controller moves motor to desired location
